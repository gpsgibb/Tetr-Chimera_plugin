This is a plugin for UCSF Chimera that interfaces it with the command line 
utility Tetr.

Tetr is an interactive menu-driven program which allows the creation and 
modification of input files for codes such as VASP, SIESTA, CASTEP etc.
This plugin allows the user to visualise the current model being constructed
in Chimera, whilst allowing the user to select atoms using the GUI and send
that selection into Tetr.

More information on Tetr can be found at:
http://nms.kcl.ac.uk/lev.kantorovitch/codes/lev00/index.html
and

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

*** Tetr only works with UNIX-based operating systems, not MS Windows ****

For this plugin, you require UCSF Chimera, which can be downloaded here:
https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html
and Tetr, which can be downloaded here:
http://nms.kcl.ac.uk/lev.kantorovitch/codes/lev00/index.html

Tetr must be compiled in order to be used. To do this, in the source directory
of Tetr, go into the Makefile and alter the line beginning "FCOMPL=" to contain
the Fortran compiler of your choice (e.g. gfortran, ifort etc...). Then set 
the environment variable HOME_TETR in your shell (e.g. inside your .bashrc)
to point to the Tetr source directory.

Finally, this directory must be placed inside the "share" directory within the
Chimera directory tree. In Linux this will be kept in:
/path/to/UCSF_Chimera/share
Whilst on MacOS this will be located in
/path/to/Chimera.app/Contents/Resources/share

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Once installed (see above), the Tetr plugin should be visible in the 
Tools -> Utilities menu in the Chimera GUI.

Upon its first launch, the Tetr plugin may prompt for the path to the Tetr
executable (unless the HOME_TETR environment variable is set). This will be
cached in $HOME/.Tetr/tetr_root.dat so you should not be prompted again.

The Tetr plugin will then ask you the path to the working directory you wish
to use.
